          Technology, a term that has revolutionized the way human live. It has
          continuously evolved over the centuries, helping humans to change the
          ways of living, working and interacting with each other. From using
          stones to spark a fire to the sophisticated marvels of the digital
          age, the journey of the development of technology reflects humanity’s
          drastic evolution and persistent pursuit of innovation. Shopping, like
          other activities has been digitized. People can shop via various apps
          and website from the comfort of their home and have the items
          delivered right to their doorstep. This process is called e commerce.

          The story of technology is as old as old as the first civilization of
          the world. The earliest civilizations driven by their needs, created
          simple tools from stones and bones of dead animals to aid in their
          hunting and survival. With the arrival of agriculture, civilizations
          developed irrigation systems and plows. The invention of round wheels
          revolutionized transportation, invention of bulbs revolutionized the
          way we see in dark, while the printing press democratized knowledge
          during the Renaissance. Traditional way of selling and buying
          groceries started with the exchange of some items with some other
          items between people (back in the day when there was no currency).
          After many years, when people introduced currency, people
          exchanged/bought items with currency.

          Throughout history, technological advancement has been driven by
          people till date. The Industrial Revolution boosted the technological
          advancement, ultimately boosting automation mechanisms, mass
          production and advance physics opening a door of prosperity for the
          people. The 20th century civilization witnessed drastic improvement in
          communication, transportation, medicines, etc. with innovations like
          the telephone, automobiles, etc. reshaping the fabric of the society.
          Traditional way of selling and buying is slowly being outdated.
          Nowadays people are able to browse through various apps and websites,
          choose their items, make online payments seamlessly and securely, and
          have the items they ordered delivered right to their homes.

          The impact of technology on human life has been mostly positive. It
          has changed the way people communicate across vast distances, changed
          the whole concept of modern medicines, improved the quality of life,
          automation, with digitization in almost everything we can objectify.
          From normal household activities to modern businesses, technology has
          helped humans come a long way. It has paved a way to prove that
          “Nothing is impossible”. In the context of shopping, technology has
          helped businesses and consumers dramatically. While businesses are
          able to sell their items online with deliveries, consumers are able to
          shop with wide selection of items with easiness and save time.

          Like a coin has both sides, similarly technology has it own pros and
          cons. Starting with automation, it has surely created human life
          easier. We can program machines to do the same work again and again.
          But diving deeper, we realize that automation threatens traditional
          roles/jobs (Job displacement). Ranging from construction labor to a
          highly skilled software engineer, technology now threatens all kinds
          of jobs as it is able to do all of it easily without any tiredness.
          How rich and poor are divided, similarly technology has created a
          division between the rich and poor once again (Digital divide).
          Similarly, online shopping/e-commerce does have some negative impacts.
          People losing their jobs, people having less social interaction
          between themselves, loss of local business that do not have easy
          access to technology, etc. People are very dependent upon technology,
          which has also led to lethargic and laziness in people.

          Technology has made the world a smaller place. Everything we do is at
          our finger tips or an internet second away. The advent of online

          browse unlimitedly and purchase grocery items and have it delivered
          right to their door from the comfort of their couch. For business,
          technology has made it easier to understand and analyze the market

          Technology is an unstoppable force that is not only reshaping the
          grocery industry but almost all the industries that are co-existing in
          the world. However, it is imperative to navigate its impacts with
          caution, addressing issues such as job displacement, digital divide,
          etc. By embracing technology while safeguarding ethical principles,
          the grocery industry can guide a pursuit towards a more sustainable
          and inclusive future.
